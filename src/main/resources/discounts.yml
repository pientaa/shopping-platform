# Discount Configuration
# =======================
# This configuration file defines the discount rules that are applied to products during price calculations.
# There are two types of discounts defined here:
# 1. Fixed Percentage Discounts
# 2. Count-Based Discounts

# 1. Fixed Percentage Discounts:
# ------------------------------
# These discounts apply a fixed percentage reduction to the total price of all products.
# The `discountModifier` represents the percentage multiplier applied to the total price.
# For example, a `discountModifier` of "0.90" means a 10% discount on the total price.

fixedPercentageDiscounts:
  - discountModifier: "0.90"
  - discountModifier: "0.95"

# 2. Count-Based Discounts:
# -------------------------
# These discounts are applied based on the quantity of specific products.
# If the number of units for a particular product exceeds the specified `threshold`,
# the `discountModifier` is applied to that product's price.
#
# Each discount has:
# - `discountModifier`: The percentage multiplier applied when the threshold is met.
# - `productId`: The ID of the product to which this discount applies.
# - `threshold`: The minimum quantity required for the discount to apply.
