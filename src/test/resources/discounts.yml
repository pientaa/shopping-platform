# Test Discount Configuration
# ===========================
# This configuration file is specifically used for testing purposes.
# It is a separate copy of the production configuration file located at `resources/discounts.yml`.
#
# The purpose of this file is to provide controlled and predictable discount rules
# that can be used in automated tests to verify the correctness of discount application logic.
#
# By separating test configuration from production configuration, we ensure:
# 1. **Isolation**: Tests run independently of the production environment, avoiding unintended side effects.
# 2. **Consistency**: The discount rules in this file remain constant across test runs, ensuring reproducible results.
# 3. **Safety**: Changes to the test configuration do not impact production systems, and vice versa.
#
# The structure and rules in this file mirror the production configuration to ensure
# that the tests accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
